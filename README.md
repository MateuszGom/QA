### [Animation] - [NPC] - [Badlands] - Jason Wildriver's phone calling animation continues even though he is unconscious, if the Player decides to grab the NPC and use either "Kill" or "Non-lethal Takedown" Action

**Priority:** P2 - Medium

**Components:** Animation

**Affect Verion/s:** 2.2

**Tags:** Gig, NPC, Badlands, Combat, Gameplay, User Experience

**Environment:** PC

**Severity:** Minor

**Steps to reproduce:**
1. Import the provided save file to a corresponding game folder containing save files (%USERPROFILE%\Saved Games\CD Projekt Red\Cyberpunk 2077)
2. Launch the title, invoke the "Load Game" sub-menu and load recently added save file named "ManualSave-47"
3. Activate "Scan" and execute "Turn Off" hack on the Security Turret located right behind Jason, to avoid being detected
4. Enter the "Crouch" state, sneak up to Jason and get close enough to trigger his phone call
5. Stand right behind Jason, use the "Grab" option and then use either "Kill" or "Non-lethal Takedown" Action
6. Observe the Jason's body when he is unconscious
7. Notice that Jason's phone calling animation continues even when he lies on the ground, causing him to suddenly get up and continue talking, despite being unconscious/dead

**Expected result:** Performing either "Kill" or "Non-lethal Takedown" Action on Jason should properly interrupt his phone call, and the animation should not play at all when he lies on the ground.

**Actual result:** Grabbing Jason and using either "Kill" or "Non-lethal Takedown" Action improperly interrupts his animation when he talks by phone. Currently, Jason collapses on the ground right after performing the chosen Action, however, he suddenly stands up and continue his conversation by phone right after being killed or knocked down.

### Description:
When the Player begins the Dakota's side mission called "Gig: MIA" on Badlands, and decides to grab and silently take down Jason Wildriver when he stands right next to a car wreck and talks by phone, they may notice that Jason's animation may be interrupted improperly. Currently, regardless of whether he was killed or just knocked down after being grabbed, his phone conversation animation continues.

The issue does not occur when Jason is killed/knocked down after finishing the phone call.
